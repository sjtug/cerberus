  challenge:
    title: "Making sure you're not a bot!"
    calculating: "Performing browser checks..."
    difficulty_speed: "Difficulty: %{difficulty}, Speed: %{speed}kH/s"
    taking_longer: "This is taking longer than expected. Please do not refresh the page."
    why_seeing: "Why am I seeing this?"
    why_seeing_body:
      part_1: >-
        You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up %{cerberus} to protect the server against abusive traffic. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.
      part_2: >-
        If you're familiar with %{anubis} by %{techaro}, Cerberus is similar - it performs a PoW challenge to verify the request. While Anubis focuses on protecting websites from AI scrapers, Cerberus takes a much more aggressive approach to protect our open-source infrastructure.
      part_3: >-
        Please note that Cerberus requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like %{jshelter} will disable. Please disable %{jshelter} or other such plugins for this domain.

    apologize_please_enable_wasm: >-
      Your browser has WebAssembly disabled via settings or an extension. It's known that some browsers (e.g. Safari with Lockdown Mode) disable WebAssembly by default.
      We apologize for the inconvenience, but please re-enable WebAssembly to proceed.

    apologize_please_enable_js: >-
      Your browser has JavaScript disabled via settings or an extension. We apologize for the inconvenience, but please re-enable JavaScript to proceed.
    do_not_reload_too_often: >-
      You can try fixing the underlying issue (if you know how) and then reload the page, or simply wait a few seconds before refreshing. However, avoid reloading too frequently as this may cause your IP address to be blocked.
    contact_us: "If you believe this is an error or have any questions, please contact us at %{mail}. Please kindly attach the request ID shown below to help us investigate."
